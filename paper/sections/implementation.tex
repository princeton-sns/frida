\section{Implementation}
\todo{
\begin{itemize}
    \item lines of code
    \item languages + library and features
    \item data storage -> localstorage
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Client-Side Library}
\todo{notes about how this is written, lines of code and how much storage it takes up, etc..., how much code is dedicated to providing certain parts of our system so showing that for example invariants are super easy to implement but detecting reordering may take uo 30\% of our code base}
\subsection{Server}
\todo{notes about how this is built, how we ensure serializability, lines of code}
